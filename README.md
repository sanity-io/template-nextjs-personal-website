# A Next.js Personal Website with a Native Authoring Experience<!-- omit in toc -->

This starter is a statically generated personal website that uses [Next.js][nextjs] for the frontend and [Sanity][sanity-homepage] to handle its content. It comes with a native Sanity Studio that offers features like real-time collaboration and visual editing with live updates using [Presentation][presentation].

The Studio connects to Sanity Content Lake, which gives you hosted content APIs with a flexible query language, on-demand image transformations, powerful patching, and more. You can use this starter to kick-start a personal website or learn these technologies.

## Features

- A performant, static personal website with editable projects
- A native and customizable authoring environment, accessible on `yourpersonalwebsite.com/studio`
- Real-time and collaborative content editing with fine-grained revision history
- Side-by-side instant content preview that works across your whole site
- Support for block content and the most advanced custom fields capability in the industry
- Webhook-triggered Incremental Static Revalidation; no need to wait for a rebuild to publish new content
- Free Sanity project with unlimited admin users, free content updates, and pay-as-you-go for API overages
- A project with starter-friendly and not too heavy-handed TypeScript and Tailwind.css

## Getting Started

### Installing the template

We will take a look at installing this template with the Sanity CLI, running locally, and lastly deploying to Vercel. If you'd rather start by deploying to Vercel, please instead reference the instructions in [`vercel-installation-instructions.md`](./vercel-installation-instructions.md)

#### 1. Initialize template with Sanity CLI

Run the command in your Terminal to initialize this template on your local computer.

See the documentation if you are [having issues with the CLI](https://www.sanity.io/help/cli-errors).

```shell
npm create sanity@latest -- --template sanity-io/template-nextjs-personal-website
```

#### 2. Run app locally in development mode

Navigate to the template directory using `cd <your app name>`, and start the development servers by running the following command

```shell
npm run dev
```

#### 3. Open the app and sign in to the Studio

Open the Next.js app running locally in your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Open the Studio by navigating to the `/studio` route [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio). You should now see a screen prompting you to log in to the Studio. Use the same service (Google, GitHub, or email) that you used when you logged in to the CLI.

### Adding content with Sanity

#### 1. Publish your first document

The template comes pre-defined with a schema containing `Page` and `Project` document types.

From the Studio, click "+ Create" and select the `Project` document type. Go ahead and create and publish the document.

Your content should now appear in your Next.js app ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) as well as in the Studio on the "Presentation" Tab

#### 2. Extending the Sanity schema

The schema for the `Post` document type is defined in the `studio/src/schemaTypes/post.ts` file. You can [add more document types](https://www.sanity.io/docs/schema-types) to the schema to suit your needs.

### Deploying your application and inviting editors

#### 1. Deploy Next.js app to Vercel

Your app is still only running on your local computer. It's time to deploy and get it into the hands of other content editors.

You have the freedom to deploy your Next.js app to your hosting provider of choice. With Vercel and GitHub being a popular choice, we'll cover the basics of that approach.

1. Create a GitHub repository from this project. [Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github).
2. Create a new Vercel project and connect it to your Github repository.
3. Configure your Environment Variables.

#### 2. Invite a collaborator

Now that you’ve deployed your Next.js application and Sanity Studio, you can optionally invite a collaborator to your Studio. Open up [Manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage), select your project and click "Invite project members"

They will be able to access the deployed Studio, where you can collaborate together on creating content.
